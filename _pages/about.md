Every organism sees and interacts with the world in a unique way. We study how neural adaptations to sensory systems contribute to natural behavior, with an appreciation for the diversity of life.

Diverse approaches studying adaptation
======
We are particularly interested in exploring (1) how behavior reflects brain function and (2) how nervous systems are organized and function to detect meaningful signals in the environment. Often, we ask these questions in a comparative context, understanding cellular and neural properties in a diverse array of systems and organisms.




Lab goals
------
Science cannot be done alone. We work together to perform thoughtful, rigorous, physiologically and ecologically relevant experiments to uncover fundamental properties of biology. We work respectfully with one another to encourage creativity and are welcoming of all perspectives. It is imperative that we engage with and communicate our findings with our communities and aspire to encourage a love for the scientific method and natural world in those who have not had not had the same opportunities as ourselves.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).
