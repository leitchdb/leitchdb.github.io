Every organism sees and interacts with the world in a unique way. We study how neural adaptations to sensory systems contribute to natural behavior, with an appreciation for the diversity of life.

Diverse approaches studying adaptation
======
We are particularly interested in exploring (1) how behavior reflects brain function and (2) how nervous systems are organized and function to detect meaningful signals in the environment. Often, we ask these questions in a comparative context, understanding cellular and neural properties in a diverse array of systems and organisms.


Lab goals
------
Science cannot be done alone. We work together to perform thoughtful, rigorous, physiologically and ecologically relevant experiments to uncover fundamental properties of biology. We work respectfully with one another to encourage creativity and are welcoming of all perspectives. It is imperative that we engage with and communicate our findings with our communities and aspire to encourage a love for the scientific method and natural world in those who have not had not had the same opportunities as ourselves.
